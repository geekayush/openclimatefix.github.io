          Open Climate Fix is a new non-profit research and
          development lab, totally focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as
          rapidly as possible. Every part of the organisation is designed to
          maximise climate impact, such as our open and collaborative approach,
          our rapid prototyping, and our attention on finding scalable &amp;
          practical solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using an open-source approach, we can draw upon a much larger pool of
          knowledge and skills than any individual company, so combining existing
          islands of knowledge and accelerating progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach will be to search for ML (Machine Learning) problems where,
          if we solve a well-defined ML task, then there is likely to be a large
          climate impact. Then, for each of these challenges, we will:

            <strong>Collate &amp; release data</strong>
            , and write software tools to make it super-easy for people to consume
            this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Run a collaborative &ldquo;global research project&rdquo;
            </strong>
            {' '}
            where everyone from 16-year-olds to PhD students to corporate research
            labs can help solve the ML task (and, over the last 6 weeks, we have
            received over 300 emails from people whoâ€™d love to get involved).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Help to put good solutions into production</strong>
            , once the community has developed them, so we can be reducing

        Our first area of focus: Solar Photovoltaics
      </h2>
      <div className="markdown">
        <p>
          Solar Photovoltaics (PV) is the largest source of uncertainty in
          electricity system operators&rsquo; forecasts. If a dark cloud moves
          across the sky, the grid can be taken by surprise and lose
          hundreds of megawatts of PV generation within minutes. This
          lost PV generation must be replaced immediately. But thermal
          generators take hours to spin-up from cold. The end result is
          that, whenever the sun is shining, the grid keeps lots of
          spinning-reserve online: mostly gas turbines, which are kept
          idling, but not generating electricity. This is expensive
          and carbon intensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grid would require less spinning reserve
          if they had better PV forecasts for the next few hours. That is,
          better PV forecasts would reduce carbon emissions, and save
          money. In the UK, better PV forecasts should save &pound;1-10
          million per year (

          <sub>2</sub>
          {' '}
          per year. Scaled up
          globally, the carbon savings should be of the order of tens of millions
          of tonnes per year.

          Our intention is that Open Climate Fix will reduce emissions by at
          least millions of tonnes, at a cost of a few dollars per tonne, so
          considerably cheaper than most other interventions.
